"Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords", "Calix default settings provide the user with a sticker and QR code that makes setup and login simple with a non-default password. The unique passwords provided are simple enough to become enumerated.",
"Insecure Network Services", "SSL Certificate is not signed, which forces the user to use HTTP during authentication with the network device over a web browser. As a result, this reveals the user's username, password hash, and the device's LLMNR hash allowing for a MITM attack either using (pass the hash), password cracking, or session hijacking. Furthermore, security misconfigurations allow username enumeration.",
